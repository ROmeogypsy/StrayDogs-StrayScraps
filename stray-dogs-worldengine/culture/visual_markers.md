# Visual Markers

## The Grey (System)
-   **Grey Jumpsuits**: Mandatory for NEPH students. Brutalist, prison-like.
-   **Concrete**: The defining texture of the North Ends.
-   **Broken Windows**: Symbol of systemic neglect ("The Grey").

## The Red (Resistance)
-   **Red Markings**: Hand-painted symbols on NEPH jumpsuits. Dame's work.
    *   **Stray**: Paw print over heart ("Sentinel").
    *   **Ruckus**: Barking dog head.
    *   **Matches**: Flame icon.
    *   **Needles**: Red cross.
-   **Tattoos**: Dame's ink. Mandatory for all 65 Dogs.
    *   **Stray**: Paw print over heart (hidden).
    *   **Scraps**: Blade dagger (West End mark, currently exposed).
    *   **Big 9**: "Lead by Doing" script.

## The Navy (Privilege)
-   **Navy Blazers**: St. Augustine's uniform. Prestigious, expensive.
-   **Designer Streetwear**: West End aesthetic. Logos, clean lines.

## Significance
-   **Identity**: What you wear defines who you are (Dog vs Academy vs West End).
-   **Resistance**: Red markings transform the prison uniform (Grey) into a badge of honor.
