# Alistair Awakening Tension

## Overview
**Alistair**, Head Boy of **St. Augustine's Academy**, is beginning to question the "proper channels" he has always trusted.

## The Conflict
-   **Internal**: "Scientia et Virtus" (Academy values) vs. systemic neglect of North Ends.
-   **Trigger**: Seeing Leo's abuse of NEPH students, Rax's odd behavior, and the efficiency of Dog justice (Stray).
-   **Symbol**: **Red Chalk** (gift from Zed/Z-Artist) sits in his desk. He hasn't used it yet, but hasn't reported it either.

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Leo Incident**: Leo attacks a NEPH student/Dog without cause.
-   **Rax Secret**: Alistair discovers Rax is a Dog (embedded agent).
-   **Red Chalk**: Alistair uses the chalk to mark Academy property (rebellion).

## Resolution Paths
-   **Transformation**: Alistair becomes a whistleblower/ally to the Dogs.
-   **Rejection**: Alistair doubles down on the system, reports Rax.
-   **Exile**: Alistair is expelled for his actions, becomes an outcast.
