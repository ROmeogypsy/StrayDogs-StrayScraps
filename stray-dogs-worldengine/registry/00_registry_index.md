# Registry Index

## Visual Registry
-   **Appearance Profiles**: Detailed visual descriptions for all 25+ named characters.
-   **Physical Details**: Clothing catalog, scars/injuries, tattoo registry, mannerisms.

## Relationship Matrices
-   **Dog Internal**: The web of loyalty, rivalry, and history within the 65.
-   **Faction Dynamics**: How groups interact (Academy vs Dogs, West End vs North Ends).

## Purpose
-   **Consistency**: Ensure every description matches the established canon.
-   **Depth**: Provide granular details ("Show, Don't Tell").
