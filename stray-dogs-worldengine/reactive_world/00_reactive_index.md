# Reactive World Index

## Purpose
The **Reactive World** system ensures that the North Ends feels alive and responsive to player/character actions. It tracks memory, rumors, faction responses, and the ripple effects of choices.

## Components
1.  **NPC Awareness**:
    -   `community_memory.md`: What the people remember.
    -   `rumor_system.md`: How stories spread.
    -   `reputation_tracker.md`: Standing with factions.
    -   `witness_records.md`: Who saw what.

2.  **Faction Responses**:
    -   Protocols for **Stray Dogs**, **Academy**, **West End**, and **Police**.
    -   Level 1-5 Escalation Ladders.

3.  **Environmental State**:
    -   `location_conditions.md`: Damage, repairs, maintenance.
    -   `time_based_populations.md`: Who is where and when.
    -   `weather_impacts.md`: Atmospheric effects.
    -   `ongoing_events.md`: Festivals, protests, etc.

4.  **Consequence Chains**:
    -   `action_consequence_tree.md`: Predictable outcomes.
    -   `escalation_triggers.md`: What makes things worse.
    -   `ripple_effect_tracker.md`: Mapping the spread of impact.
