## HOW TO DESCRIBE SNOUT IN SCENES

### First Appearance:
> Snout sat in the corner booth of the Marlowe Arms, almost part of the furniture. His flat cap was pulled low, but his eyes behind the thick glasses missed nothing. He looked like every grandfather in the North Ends—which was exactly the point.

### Subsequent Mentions:
> Snout polished his glasses with a rag.
> The old man winked.
