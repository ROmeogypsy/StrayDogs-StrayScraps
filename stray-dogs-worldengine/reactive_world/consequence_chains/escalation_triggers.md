## DE-ESCALATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Level 4 → Level 3:
- Negotiation (rare, requires neutral party)
- Tribute paid (money, territory concession)
- Mutual stand-down (both sides agree)

### Level 3 → Level 2:
- Time passes without incident (weeks)
- Bigger threat emerges (common enemy)
- Leadership change (new boss less aggressive)
