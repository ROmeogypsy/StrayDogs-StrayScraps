# High Command

## Overview
The five leaders of the Stray Dogs. Each holds a specific role in the organization.

## Members
-   **Big 9**: Founder, Spiritual Leader. Currently imprisoned (Whole Life Order). Philosophy: "Lead by Doing".
-   **Dame**: Operations Leader, Matriarch, Videographer, Tattoo Artist. Runs the day-to-day.
-   **Snout**: Intelligence Coordinator, "The Vet", Community Liaison. Runs the Snouts Network (eyes everywhere).
-   **Zed**: Underboss, Strategic Thinker. Scars from the drag (Late 2023). Handles the hard choices.
-   **Chew-toy**: Operations Manager, NEPH Dog Coordinator. Handles logistics, schedules, and the 30 frontline Dogs.

## Decision Making
-   **Consensus**: Major decisions (like Scraps joining) require unanimous High Command approval.
-   **Big 9's Voice**: Even from prison, his philosophy guides every choice. Dame visits him weekly (when allowed).
-   **Zed's Rise**: Since the drag, Zed has become the defacto strategic leader, balancing Dame's emotion.

## Current Tensions (Feb 2026)
-   **Big 9's Absence**: The void is palpable. Dame is struggling.
-   **Scraps**: High Command is split on trusting him fully (Zed is wary, Dame is hopeful, Snout is pragmatic).
-   **West End Threat**: Preparing for retaliation.
