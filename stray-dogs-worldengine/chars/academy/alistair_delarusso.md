# Alistair Delarusso (Head Boy)

## Overview
Age: 18. Head Boy of **St. Augustine's Academy**. Wealthy, privileged, but deeply conflicted. The embodiment of "Proper Channels" who is starting to see the cracks in the system.

## Physical Description
-   **Build**: Tall, classic, athletic (Lacrosse captain).
-   **Face**: Strong jaw, serious eyes, perfectly groomed.
-   **Clothing**: Immaculate Academy navy blazer (the ideal student).
-   **Distinctive**: Always checks his watch (6:34 AM patrol). Carries a piece of **Red Chalk** in his pocket (Zed's gift).

## Personality
-   **Honorable**: Believes in "Scientia et Virtus" (Knowledge and Virtue).
-   **Rigid**: Struggles when rules conflict with justice.
-   **Questioning**: Starting to realize the Academy protects privilege, not people.

## Operations
-   **Head Boy**: Leads the Prefect body. Liaison to administration.
-   **Patrol**: 6:34 AM Plaza patrol. Clocks everyone.
-   **Mediator**: Tries to keep peace between Academy/NEPH students.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
-   **Awakening**: Disturbed by Leo's cruelty and the NEPH students' suffering.
-   **Red Chalk**: Hasn't used it yet, but hasn't reported it either. A symbol of choice.
-   **Stray**: Investigating him. Sees a "homeless kid" who acts with more honor than Leo.

## Relationships
-   **Nala**: VP/Head Girl. Finds her gossip exhausting but useful.
-   **Leo**: Growing to despise his bully tactics.
-   **Rax**: Lacrosse teammate. Respects his skill, suspects his secret.
-   **K-9**: Finds him disruptive but undeniably charismatic.
