# Red Light Protection

## Overview
The core operation of the **Stray Dogs**. Providing safety to the 40+ workers in **The Hydrant** district.

## Mechanics
-   **Shifts**: Morning (6AM-2PM), Afternoon (2PM-10PM), Graveyard (2AM-6AM).
-   **Presence**: Visible patrol ("Lead by Doing").
-   **Safehouses**: 3 designated safe buildings for workers to retreat to.
-   **Response**: Immediate intervention if a worker signals (Whistle code).

## Economics
-   **Contribution**: Workers pay ~15% of earnings voluntarily (~£6k-8k/month).
-   **Usage**: Funds the Kennel, supplies, and bail for Dogs.

## Significance
-   **Trust**: The reason the Silence Protocol holds. The community sees the work.
-   **Danger**: High risk (drunks, pimps, rival gangs).
