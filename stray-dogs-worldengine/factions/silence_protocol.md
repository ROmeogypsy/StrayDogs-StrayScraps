# The Silence Protocol

## Overview
The unwritten law of the North Ends: **"We Protect Us"**. The community refuses to cooperate with the police, not out of fear, but out of loyalty to the Stray Dogs.

## How It Works
1.  **Police Inquiry**: "Did you see who stopped the assault?"
2.  **Community Response**: "No comment." "I was looking the other way." "Just kids playing."
3.  **Result**: Police have no witnesses, no evidence, no case. Dogs operate freely.

## Why It Works
-   **Consent**: The Dogs exist because the community *allows* them to.
-   **Trust**: Decades of police neglect vs. years of Dog protection.
-   **Reciprocity**: The Dogs protect the community (free/low cost), the community protects the Dogs (silence).

## Exceptions (Hypothetical)
-   **Broken Trust**: If Dogs start extorting, harming innocents, or acting like a gang, the Silence breaks.
-   **Big 9's Nightmare**: The fear that the Dogs will become what they fight.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
-   **Unbreakable**: Despite West End pressure and police scrutiny, the Silence holds firm.
-   **Example**: When Stray disarmed the West End leader, 50 witnesses saw it. Police report: "Altercation, suspects fled, no witnesses."
