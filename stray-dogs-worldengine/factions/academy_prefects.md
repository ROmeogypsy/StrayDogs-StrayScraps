# Academy Prefects

## Overview
Student enforcement body at **St. Augustine's Academy**. Charged with maintaining order, "proper channels", and protecting the school's reputation. Navy blazers, citation pads, authority.

## Members
-   **Alistair**: Head Boy. 6:34 AM patrol. Red chalk keeper. Transformation arc (questioning the system).
-   **Nala**: Head Girl/VP. Gossip queen. Boyfriend theory (believes Rax/K-9 are dating). Instagram: @AugustinesInsider.
-   **Leo**: Prefect. Power-tripper. Fountain victim (drenched by Rax). Hates NEPH students.

## Operations
-   **Plaza Patrols**: Monitor the neutral ground. Issue citations for minor infractions (loitering, littering).
-   **Surveillance**: Report "unusual activity" to administration.
-   **Student Conduct**: Enforce Academy rules on and off campus.

## Philosophy
-   **Proper Channels**: Believe the system works if you follow the rules. (Alistair is starting to doubt this).
-   **Tradition**: Protect the Academy's legacy ("Scientia et Virtus").
-   **Superiority**: View NEPH students as "future inmates" or "charity cases".

## Current Tensions (Feb 2026)
-   **Alistair vs Leo**: Alistair is growing weary of Leo's aggression toward NEPH students.
-   **Rax's Secret**: Prefects suspect Rax is hiding something (Leo specifically targets him).
-   **K-9**: The "celebrity" rapper at the Academy is a disruption to order.
