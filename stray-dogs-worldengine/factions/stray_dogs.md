# The Stray Dogs

## Overview
A community-led protection force of 65 members (NEPH, SEPH, Academy students) dedicated to protecting the North Ends from gangs, police brutality, and exploitation. Founded in 2020 by Big 9, Dame, and Snout.

## Philosophy
1.  **Lead by Doing**: Actions over words.
2.  **Protect Based on Need**: Anyone vulnerable gets protection, regardless of affiliation.
3.  **Community Consent**: We exist because the community allows us (Silence Protocol).

## Structure
-   **High Command**: Big 9 (Founder/Spiritual Leader, imprisoned), Dame (Ops Leader), Snout (Intel Chief), Zed (Underboss/Strategy), Chew-toy (Ops Manager).
-   **Frontline (NEPH)**: 30 members. Grey jumpsuits, red markings.
-   **Embedded (Academy)**: Rax, K-9 (intelligence, resources).
-   **Ghosts (SEPH)**: 14 scouts (intelligence network).
-   **New Member**: Scraps (The 65th Dog, conditional).

## Resources
-   **Income**: ~£15k/month (Red Light protection, SD Media, donations).
-   **Expenses**: ~£5k/month (Kennel, safehouses, supplies, bail).
-   **Surplus**: Saved for emergencies.
-   **Equipment**: Burner phones, basic medical kits, WAG ON (van), recording gear.

## Reputation (Feb 2026)
-   **North Ends**: Heroes/Protectors ("The Silence").
-   **Academy**: Thugs/criminals (mostly).
-   **West End**: Dangerous rivals.
-   **Police**: A problem they can't solve (community won't talk).
