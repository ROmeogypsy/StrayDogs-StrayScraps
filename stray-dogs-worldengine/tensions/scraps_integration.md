# Scraps Integration Tension

## Overview
**Scraps** (formerly Harper Whitmore, West End Prince) has been conditionally accepted into the Dogs as the 65th member. This has caused a massive internal rift.

## The Conflict
-   **Pro-Scraps**: High Command (Zed sees potential, Dame sees redemption, Stray claimed him).
-   **Anti-Scraps**: NEPH Dogs (led by Ruckus, whom Scraps hospitalized for 3 weeks).
-   **Reasoning**: "He hurt us. He's rich. He's a traitor." vs "He saved Stray. He has nowhere else. He can be transformed."

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Ruckus Conflict**: Level 2 (Verbal abuse) → Level 3 (Physical confrontation in The Kennel).
-   **West End Attack**: If Scraps fails to defend a Dog, or if his presence brings war to NEPH.
-   **Trust Test**: Scraps must prove loyalty in a high-stakes situation (saving a Dog's life).

## Resolution Paths
-   **Success**: Scraps saves Ruckus/NEPH Dog, earns respect, gets permanent tattoo.
-   **Failure**: Scraps betrays Dogs/flees, is expelled or killed.
-   **Stalemate**: Scraps remains on probation indefinitely, tension simmers.
