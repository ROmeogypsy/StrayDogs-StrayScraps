# SEPH Ghosts (The 14)

## Overview
14 "Ghost Dogs" who attend **South Ends Public High (SEPH)**. Their role is pure intelligence and observation. They are the "Eyes" of the Dogs in the South.

## Identification
-   **Subtle**: No grey jumpsuits or obvious red paint.
-   **Marking**: Red shoe laces, small dog head on hoodie wrist (visible only if you know where to look).
-   **Recruitment**: Hand-picked by Snout/Chew-toy for observation skills, not combat.

## Operations
-   **Intelligence Network**: Feed information to Snout and Chew-toy.
-   **Early Warning**: Watch for rival gangs moving north from South Ends.
-   **Recruitment Pools**: Identify potential Dogs among the SEPH student body.

## Philosophy
-   **Observer First**: Avoid combat. Report and retreat.
-   **Unseen**: "Ghosts" because they are rarely noticed until it's too late.

## Current Tensions (Feb 2026)
-   **South Gang Activity**: Reporting increased movement in South Ends.
-   **West End Scouts**: Tracking West End members attempting to infiltrate South Ends.
