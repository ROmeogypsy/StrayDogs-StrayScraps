# Matches (The Flame)

## Overview
Age: 17. Chaos Agent and Pyromaniac. **The Flame** of the NEPH Frontline. Known for unpredictability and hot-wiring vehicles. Always playing with a lighter.

## Physical Description
-   **Build**: Wiry, energetic, constantly moving.
-   **Face**: Smudged with soot or grease. Eyes gleam (dangerously).
-   **Clothing**: Grey NEPH jumpsuit, blackened at the cuffs. Red flame painted on chest.
-   **Distinctive**: Zippo lighter always flicking open and shut.

## Personality
-   **Unpredictable**: "Controlled chaos is still chaos."
-   **Destructive**: Loves fire, explosions, and breaking things (for the cause).
-   **Impulsive**: Often acts before thinking (needs Chew-toy/Ruckus to rein him in).

## Operations
-   **Hot-Wire Specialist**: Can steal a car in 30 seconds (for emergencies/WAG ON).
-   **Distraction**: Sets small fires/explosions to draw police/gang attention.
-   **Saboteur**: Disables rival vehicles/equipment.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
-   **Bored**: Craving action. West End war sounds fun to him.
-   **Dangerous**: High Command worries he'll start a fire he can't put out.
-   **Scraps**: Sees him as a challenge/new toy. "Does he burn?"

## Relationships
-   **Ruckus**: Often paired (muscle + chaos).
-   **Chew-toy**: His eternal headache.
-   **Stray**: Scared of him (Stray's silence unnerves him).
