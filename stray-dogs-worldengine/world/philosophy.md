# Dog Philosophy

## 1. LEAD BY DOING
Words are cheap. Actions build trust.
-   **Big 9's Principle**: We don't ask for permission to protect. We protect, and the community consents by not calling the police.
-   **Stray's Embodiment**: He doesn't give speeches. He takes the graveyard shift. He stands three doors down.

## 2. PROTECT BASED ON NEED
Protection is not transactional.
-   **Not Tribe-Based**: We protect anyone in the North Ends who is vulnerable—even enemies (like Scraps) if they are being hunted.
-   **No Favorites**: A Red Light worker gets the same protection as a shop owner or a Dog's family member.

## 3. COMMUNITY CONSENT (THE SILENCE)
Power comes from the people, not the weapon.
-   **The Silence Protocol**: The community refuses to speak to the police not out of fear, but out of loyalty.
-   **Earned Daily**: Every shift, every intervention earns the right to exist for another day.
-   **No Bribes**: We don't extort. We don't tax. We are supported voluntarily.

## 4. RADICAL MERCY
Transformation is possible.
-   **The Scraps Precedent**: An enemy can become an ally if they truly change.
-   **Costly Grace**: Mercy isn't free. It cost Scraps his old life. It cost the Dogs their safety (West End war). But it's worth it.
