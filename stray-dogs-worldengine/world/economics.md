# Economics of the North Ends

## INCOME SOURCES & LIMITS

### STRAY DOGS REVENUE
-   **Red Light Protection**: £6,000-8,000/month
    *   (40 workers × £150-200 average/month × 15% = ~£900-1,200/week)
-   **SD Media**: £3,000-5,000/month (YouTube, streaming, merch)
    *   (Hundreds of thousands of followers, but independent = lower revenue)
-   **Community Donations**: £1,000-2,000/month (voluntary, irregular)
-   **TOTAL**: ~£10,000-15,000/month for 65 Dogs

### EXPENSES
-   **The Kennel**: £800/month (utilities, internet, equipment maintenance)
-   **WAG ON**: £300/month (fuel, insurance, repairs)
-   **Medical Supplies**: £400/month (Needles' kit, emergency supplies)
-   **Food for Members**: £2,000/month (many Dogs have irregular access)
-   **Burner Phones**: £200/month (operational security)
-   **Tattoo Supplies**: £150/month (Dame's equipment, ink)
-   **Red Light Safehouses**: £900/month (3 buildings, heat, basic utilities)
-   **Miscellaneous**: £500/month (clothing repairs, emergency funds)
-   **TOTAL**: ~£5,250/month baseline

### SURPLUS
-   £4,750-9,750/month
-   **Usage**: Saved for emergencies, bail (rare but needed), expansion, individual Dog support.

## WHAT DOGS CAN AFFORD
-   ✅ Basic operations (protection, intelligence, community support)
-   ✅ Modest equipment (phones, recording gear, medical supplies)
-   ✅ Helping members in crisis (rent assistance, food, bail occasionally)
-   ✅ Small business investments (improving Kennel, safehouses)

## WHAT DOGS CANNOT AFFORD
-   ❌ Matching West End's wealth (they have hundreds of members, more income streams)
-   ❌ High-end weapons/equipment (beyond what community provides)
-   ❌ Bribing officials (Silence Protocol is consent, not money)
-   ❌ Rapid expansion (recruiting costs, equipment for new members)

## RESOURCE RULES
-   **Working Class**: Dogs are NOT poor, but NOT rich.
-   **Sustainability**: Purchases require planning/saving.
-   **Independence**: SD Media success helps but isn't a goldmine (independent = limited).
-   **Community**: Provides some resources free (food donations, safe spaces).
