# Pre-2010: The Decline of the North Ends

## Overview
Before the Stray Dogs existed, the **North Ends** was already rotting. Decades of institutional neglect, police indifference, and widening class division created the conditions that made a community protection force inevitable. This is the soil from which the Dogs grew.

## The North Ends Before the Dogs

### Systemic Neglect
-   **Police Withdrawal**: Metropolitan Police reduced patrols through the 1990s and 2000s. Response times stretched to hours for non-violent calls. North Ends became a statistical afterthought.
-   **Council Defunding**: Youth centres closed. Community centres shuttered. Libraries reduced to skeleton hours. The infrastructure that held communities together was stripped for budget savings.
-   **The Housing Squeeze**: Social housing stock decayed. Repairs delayed for years. Families packed into brutalist estates designed in the 1960s for temporary housing, now permanent.

### The Red Light District (Pre-Protection)
-   **Unprotected Workers**: The six blocks centred on Hydrant Street operated with zero protection. Workers policed themselves. Violence was routine, unreported, and ignored.
-   **Pimp Networks**: Multiple exploitative networks ran operations, taking up to 70% of workers' earnings. No one intervened.
-   **Police Complicity**: Officers occasionally arrested workers for solicitation but never pursued violent clients or pimps. The message was clear: you are not worth protecting.

### The Class Divide Solidifies
-   **St. Augustine's Academy** (est. 1890s): Gothic Revival towers overlooking the North Ends from The Hill. Tuition at £18,000/year even before inflation. Latin motto carved in stone: *"Scientia et Virtus."* The school had always been there, watching the North Ends from above.
-   **NEPH (The Doghouse)**: North Ends Public High opened in the brutalist wave, 800 students in grey jumpsuits. Underfunded from day one. Teachers left faster than they could be replaced. The community called it what it was: a prison pipeline.
-   **The Plaza**: The only neutral ground where four school territories converged. Even then, the fountain in the centre and the benches around it were the closest thing to shared public space the borough had left.

## Key Figures Before the Pack

### Snout (Born ~1981)
-   Grew up in the North Ends. Knew every street, every shopkeeper, every grandmother.
-   Watched the neighbourhood deteriorate through the 1990s and 2000s.
-   Built his network of community contacts decades before the Dogs existed. Quiet conversations at the Marlowe Arms Pub. Favours traded, debts remembered.
-   Never a fighter. Always a listener. The ears of the North Ends before anyone gave the role a name.

### Captain Shaw (HM Royal Guard, Active Service)
-   Served with distinction in HM Royal Guard. Details of service sealed under **HM Protective Services**.
-   Honourable discharge (date unclear, records sealed).
-   Relationship with Stray's mother: identity unknown, protected by Shaw's silence and sealed records.
-   Shaw's personal philosophy of discipline, honour, and action-over-words would later echo in the Dogs' "Lead by Doing" — though Shaw predated the Dogs entirely.

### Big 9 (Born ~1998)
-   Born and raised in the North Ends. Twelve years older than his brother K-9.
-   Childhood shaped by absence: absent police, absent funding, absent hope.
-   Even as a teenager, Big 9 was physically imposing and instinctively protective.
-   First recorded protective act (unofficial, pre-Dogs): intervened in an assault outside the Marlowe Arms Pub, age 16. Snout noticed.

### Dame (Born ~1999)
-   Russian-born, arrived in the North Ends as a child.
-   Learned tattooing from local artists. Picked up a camera. Documented what she saw — the decay, the resilience, the people who stayed.
-   Met Big 9 in her late teens. The connection was immediate and permanent.

### Havenwood Care Centre
-   A children's care home operating in the North Ends. Eventually closed under unclear circumstances.
-   Connection to Captain Shaw implied but unconfirmed.
-   Investigation into closure remains sealed.
-   **Mystery**: Where did the children go? What were they investigating? Why was it closed?

## The West End (Pre-Gang Formation)
-   The **West End District** had always been wealthier, but organized criminal activity consolidated in the 2000s.
-   Profit-driven operations: drug distribution, protection rackets, loan sharking.
-   The gang that would become the **West End Gang** grew from loose crews into a structured organization with designer aesthetics and territorial ambition.
-   Early expansion attempts into North Ends were opportunistic — testing boundaries that no one defended.

## Significance
-   **The Void**: Every system that should have protected the North Ends had abandoned it. Police, council, schools, social services — all withdrew or decayed.
-   **The Seed**: The people who would become the Stray Dogs were already forming. Snout was listening. Big 9 was watching. Dame was recording. Shaw was training his son.
-   **The Inevitability**: The Dogs didn't emerge from nothing. They emerged because nothing else remained.
