# NEPH Frontline (The 30)

## Overview
The 30 "Frontline" Dogs who attend **North Ends Public High (NEPH)**. Recognizable by their mandatory grey jumpsuits with hand-painted red markings (Dame's work). They are the visible face of Dog protection.

## Members
-   **Ruckus**: "The Bark". Enforcer. Loud, aggressive, physically strong. Hospitalized by Scraps (resentful).
-   **Whistle**: "The Ears". Intelligence, lip-reader, observer, quiet. Stray's right hand in the Red Light.
-   **Matches**: "The Flame". Chaos agent, pyromaniac, hot-wire specialist. Unpredictable.
-   **Needles**: "The Medic". 16 years old. Saved Zed's life. Street medicine specialist.
-   **Stray**: "The Silent Sentinel". Graveyard shift protector. 17. Homeless. High Command-adjacent but stays Frontline by choice.

## Operations
-   **Shift System**: Red Light protection (Morning/Afternoon/Graveyard).
-   **Community Patrols**: Walk the North Ends, visible presence.
-   **School Defense**: Protect NEPH students from rival gangs (mostly West End).

## Current Tensions (Feb 2026)
-   **Scraps**: NEPH Dogs are the most skeptical. Ruckus leads the "anti-Scraps" sentiment.
-   **West End War**: Expecting attacks at NEPH or on patrol.
-   **Academy Students**: Tension with "The Hill" students at the Plaza.
