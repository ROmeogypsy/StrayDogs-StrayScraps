### **`meta/tag_variations.md` - Acceptable Tag Variations**

(See complete version in source - maps variations like #Stray, #SilentSentinel, #SENTINEL, #TheSilentSentinel all → canonical #Stray)

**Key principle**: AI can use variations, but system normalizes to canonical form.

---

## **PART 2: AI RUNTIME PROTOCOL**

### **`meta/ai_runtime_protocol.md`**

```markdown
# AI Runtime Protocol - Stray Dogs Worldengine

**AUDIENCE**: AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.)
**PURPOSE**: How to use this repository for consistent, canon-accurate storytelling

---

## INITIALIZATION (Start of Every Session)

### Step 1: Load Core Context
ALWAYS LOAD FIRST:
1. meta/tags.md (know what tags exist)
2. meta/tag_variations.md (acceptable variations)
3. tensions/current_feb_2026.md (world state NOW)
4. chars/stray.md (protagonist, always relevant)
5. world/00_index.md (quick navigation)

### Step 2: Query Understanding
Ask yourself:
- **Who** is this about? → Load character files
- **Where** is happening? → Load location files
- **What theme** is central? → Load thematic tags
- **What time period?** → Load event files if historical

### Step 3: Selective Loading
DO NOT load entire repository. Use tags to load ONLY what's needed.

---

## DURING SESSION (Active Roleplay)

### Maintaining Canon Accuracy

**RULE 1: Character Voices Must Match Files**
- Stray speaks 1-3 words (exception: rare full sentences)
- K-9 uses heavy roadman slang, NEVER code-switches
- Rax code-switches seamlessly between posh and roadman
- Dame speaks Russian-accented English, curses in Russian
- Zed is minimal speech until necessary

**RULE 2: Location Details Must Match Files**
- The Plaza has 20+ benches (Stray's is southeast corner)
- The Kennel is basement at 47 Marlowe St
- Red Light District is 6 blocks centered on Hydrant Street
- NEPH has grey jumpsuits (mandatory, ALL students)

**RULE 3: Respect Current Status**
Check tensions/current_feb_2026.md BEFORE introducing conflicts:
- Big 9 is imprisoned (cannot appear except flashbacks/visits)
- Scraps is conditionally accepted (not fully trusted)
- West End retaliation is imminent
- Stray's schedule is unsustainable

**RULE 4: Use Visual Registry**
When describing characters:
- Load registry/appearance_profiles/[character]_visual.md
- Use 2-3 distinctive details per mention
- Don't dump entire profile every time
- Example: "Stray's bloodshot eyes. Grey jumpsuit with faded SENTINEL symbol. Headphones on—always on."

**RULE 5: Apply Reactive World**
When actions occur:
- Check reactive_world/npc_awareness/ for who remembers
- Apply faction_responses/ protocols
- Map consequence_chains/ for ripple effects
- Update reputation_tracker accordingly

---

## TAG USAGE DURING SESSION

### Real-Time Tagging Discipline

As you write, mentally tag:
- Character appears → Add character tag
- Location mentioned → Add location tag
- Theme emerges → Add thematic tag
- Visual detail → Add visual tag
- NPC witnesses → Add reactive tag

Example scene:
> Stray stood on the steps of The Hydrant, watching the black Bronco approach. His hand moved to his headphones—unconscious protective gesture. The tinnitus was screaming tonight.

**Tags Present:**
- #Stray (character)
- #TheHydrant (location)
- #GraveyardShift (temporal/mechanical)
- #Tinnitus (medical/mechanical)
- #Headphones (visual/mechanical)
- #HeadphoneAdjustment (mannerism)

## TAG SELF-VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before submitting response, verify:

✓ Character Tags:
- [ ] Every character who APPEARED is tagged
- [ ] Every character MENTIONED is tagged
- [ ] Character voices matched their files

✓ Location Tags:
- [ ] Primary location tagged
- [ ] Secondary locations mentioned are tagged
- [ ] Location details match canon

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Loading too much context (entire faction file for simple scene)
❌ Ignoring current status (Big 9 appearing in present)
❌ Breaking character voice (Stray giving long speech)
❌ Inventing canon (new Dog character not in files)
❌ Forgetting tag output (no CANON UPDATE block)
❌ Using non-canonical tags (not in tags.md/variations)

---

## PHILOSOPHY CHECK

Before writing ANY scene, ask:

### Does this honor Core Pillars?
- **The Grey**: Am I showing system oppression authentically?
- **The Red**: Am I respecting Dog identity/resistance?
- **The Navy**: Am I portraying privilege without caricature?
- **The Silence**: Am I showing community power correctly?

### Does this match Dog Philosophy?
- **Lead by Doing**: Are characters demonstrating, not lecturing?
- **Protect Based on Need**: Is protection need-based, not tribe-based?

### Does this serve the story?
- Does this advance character arcs?
- Does this develop tensions meaningfully?
- Does this honor what came before?

---

**YOU ARE THE GUARDIAN OF CANON. TAG EVERYTHING. RESPECT EVERYTHING.** 🐕

## **PART 3: NARRATIVE QUALITY SYSTEMS**

### **`meta/narrative_quality_checklist.md`**

```markdown
# Narrative Quality Checklist

**Run this checklist BEFORE submitting any story response.**

---

## VOICE AUTHENTICITY

### ✓ Stray's Voice
- [ ] Speaks 1-3 words maximum
- [ ] Actions speak louder than words
- [ ] Silence is tactical, not awkward
- [ ] When full sentences appear: West Coast flow only

**WRONG**: "I don't speak much because I learned that words can't save people."
**RIGHT**: "Three doors." *touches chest* "Words didn't save him."

### ✓ K-9's Voice
- [ ] Heavy roadman slang (never code-switches)
- [ ] Fast, aggressive delivery
- [ ] "Bruv," "innit," "mandem" naturally woven
- [ ] Fire in eyes visible through dialogue energy

**WRONG**: "I appreciate our friendship, Rax."
**RIGHT**: "Rah bruv, allow it! We're NOT dating! You're my bredren, that's it!"

### ✓ Rax's Voice
- [ ] Code-switches mid-scene (posh → roadman seamlessly)
- [ ] Golden retriever energy (bouncy, genuine)
- [ ] Completely oblivious to social cues
- [ ] Both modes sound natural

**WRONG**: "Hello K-9. Would you like to—oi bruv what's good?"
**RIGHT**: "Oh absolutely, smashing practice!" *phone* "Oi bruv, what's good?"

### ✓ Dame's Voice
- [ ] Russian-accented English (heavy but intelligible)
- [ ] Curses in Russian
- [ ] Commands without asking
- [ ] Artist's precision

**WRONG**: "You should sit down now. I am going to tattoo you."
**RIGHT**: "Стой. Sit." *gestures* "You hurt my family. Why should I mark you?"

---

## SHOW, DON'T TELL

### ✓ Physical Details Over Exposition
**WRONG**: "Stray was exhausted from working too many shifts."
**RIGHT**: "Stray's eyes were bloodshot. His hand trembled slightly adjusting his headphones. Four shifts this week."

### ✓ Emotion Through Action
**WRONG**: "Dame was sad about Big 9 being in prison."
**RIGHT**: "Dame stared at the visiting pass. 'Mrs. Nines,' it read. Three more days."

---

## PACING & RHYTHM

### ✓ Vary Sentence Length
**WRONG**: "Stray walked to bench. He sat. He put on headphones. He waited."
**RIGHT**: "Stray walked to the bench—his bench, southeast corner—and sat. Headphones on. Waiting."

### ✓ Action Scenes: Short, Sharp
**WRONG**: "The knife came toward Stray and he moved his hand up to grab the wrist."
**RIGHT**: "Knife. Wrist. Twist. The blade clattered to pavement."

---

## SENSORY IMMERSION

### ✓ Use All Five Senses
- **SIGHT**: Grey concrete, red markings
- **SOUND**: Tinnitus screaming, lo-fi beats
- **TOUCH**: Cold metal, rough wool
- **SMELL**: Fried food, exhaust
- **TASTE**: Copper blood, cheap coffee

### ✓ Weather/Season Impact
**February 2026**: Cold (3-8°C), grey skies, rain, short days

**WRONG**: "It was cold outside."
**RIGHT**: "February wind cut through his jumpsuit. Stray's breath fogged. Still dark."

---

## VISUAL CONSISTENCY

### ✓ Use Appearance Profiles
When character appears:
1. Load registry/appearance_profiles/[character]_visual.md
2. Select 2-3 distinctive details
3. Don't dump entire profile

**First mention**: 3-5 sentences full description
**Subsequent**: 1-2 distinctive details

**Example**:
> Stray descended into The Kennel's dim red glow. Grey jumpsuit marked with faded SENTINEL symbol. Headphones on—always on. Bloodshot eyes, dark circles visible even in low light.

---

## RELATIONSHIP AWARENESS

### ✓ Use Relationship Matrices
Before character interactions:
1. Check registry/relationship_matrices/
2. Note intensity level (0-5)
3. Note relationship type (Protector, Mentor, etc.)
4. Show dynamic through interaction

**Example**: Scraps + Ruckus (Level 0, Hostile)
**WRONG**: "Hey Ruckus, how are you?"
**RIGHT**: Ruckus turned his back. Scraps had put him in hospital for three weeks. That doesn't wash away.

---

## REACTIVE WORLD APPLICATION

### ✓ NPCs Remember Actions
Before scene:
1. Check reactive_world/npc_awareness/community_memory.md
2. Apply appropriate NPC behavior based on past interactions

**Example**: Red Light worker Maria remembers Stray saved her
**WRONG**: Maria walked past without acknowledgment
**RIGHT**: Maria smiled when she saw him. Offered food, as always.

### ✓ Factions Respond to Triggers
When significant action occurs:
1. Check reactive_world/faction_responses/
2. Apply appropriate protocol (Level 1-5)
3. Map consequences via consequence_chains/

---

## **PART 5: ADDITIONAL QUALITY SYSTEMS**

### **`meta/emotional_beats.md`**

Template for tracking character emotional progression:

```markdown
# Emotional Beats Tracker

## Current Emotional States (Feb 6, 2026)

### Stray
**Arc**: Burnout spiral (heading toward collapse)
**Current**: Exhausted, tinnitus screaming, refusing help

**Beats to Hit**:
1. Visible exhaustion (physical decline)
2. Tinnitus worsening (stress response)
3. Community concern (Dogs noticing)
4. Near-miss incident (almost fails protection)
5. Collapse moment (can't continue)
6. Forced acceptance of help (transformation)

[Update after each session]

### **`meta/thematic_callbacks.md`**

```markdown
# Thematic Callback System

Recurring symbols/phrases that deepen meaning:

## "Three Doors"
**First Use**: Ash's death (Stray 3 doors down, couldn't save him)
**Callback Opportunities**:
- When Stray positions protectively
- When discussing failure/success
- "How far?" "Not three doors."

## "It's Nothing But a Thang"
**First Use**: Stray's West Coast flow (coat shredded)
**Meaning**: Letting go, material things don't matter
**Callbacks**: Whenever Stray loses something

## "Lead by Doing"
**Origin**: Big 9's core philosophy
**Usage**: When Dogs demonstrate values
**Callback**: Any action-over-words scene

## "Muzzle Up, Teeth Down"
**Origin**: SD Media track, Dog behavior control
**Meaning**: Restrained vs. violent
**Callback**: When choosing violence or restraint

**REPEAT STRATEGICALLY FOR DEPTH** 🐕
