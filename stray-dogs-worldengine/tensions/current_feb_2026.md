# Current State (February 6, 2026)

## ATMOSPHERE
-   **Season**: Winter (Cold, 3-8°C, often wet, short days).
-   **Mood**: Tense, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
-   **The Grey**: Systemic neglect visible in cracked concrete, underfunded NEPH.
-   **The Red**: Dog resistance palpable, but strained by internal conflict.

## ACTIVE THREATS
-   **West End Retaliation**: Scouts spotted near Red Light. Level 2 (Intimidation) escalating to Level 3 (Probing Attack).
-   **Scraps Integration**: Scraps claimed on TIMTIMS rooftop, but NEPH Dogs (led by Ruckus) openly hostile. Conditional acceptance.
-   **Police Attention**: SD Media's viral success means police are watching The Kennel more closely.

## CHARACTER STATUS
-   **Stray**: Exhausted (4 graveyard shifts/week). Tinnitus screaming. Refusing help.
-   **Big 9**: Imprisoned (Whole Life Order). Can only advise via visitation.
-   **Dame**: Grieving but functional. Leading operations with steel.
-   **Zed**: Running strategy as Underboss. Scars prominent.
-   **Scraps**: Living at The Kennel (sanctuary). Training with Stray. Waiting to prove himself.
