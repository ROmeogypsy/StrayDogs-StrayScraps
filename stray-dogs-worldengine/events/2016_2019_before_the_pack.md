# 2016-2019: Before the Pack

## Overview
The four years before the Stray Dogs were formally founded. Big 9's protective instincts were becoming organised. Dame was documenting. Snout was connecting. The Red Light District was drowning. And the community was learning that no one was coming to save them.

## Big 9's Informal Protection (~2016-2019)

### The Lone Wolf Phase
-   Big 9 (18-21) patrolled North Ends streets without a name, without a crew, without a plan. He simply appeared where trouble appeared.
-   Shopkeepers began leaving their doors unlocked when they saw him walking past. Workers on Hydrant Street breathed easier on nights he was visible.
-   **No payment**. No favours asked. This confused people — every other protector in the borough extracted a price. Big 9's only currency was action.

### The First Red Light Intervention
-   A pimp beat a worker badly enough to hospitalise her. Police took a statement and filed it in a drawer.
-   Big 9 found the pimp. What happened next was not recorded, but the pimp left the North Ends permanently.
-   **Word spread**: There is a large man in the North Ends who will hurt you if you hurt the workers. The workers didn't know his name yet. They called him "that big one." The number came later.

### Community Response
-   Older residents remembered a time when the community policed itself — before the councils, before the police withdrew, before the rot set in.
-   Big 9 wasn't new. He was a return to something the North Ends had forgotten it needed.

## Dame's Documentation (~2017-2019)

### The Camera as Witness
-   Dame began filming North Ends life: the closed youth centres, the crumbling estates, the workers on Hydrant Street, the kids in grey jumpsuits walking to NEPH.
-   Her footage was not activism — it was evidence. A record that this place existed, that people lived here, that they were being forgotten.

### The Ink
-   Dame tattooed Big 9 first. Then friends. Then anyone in the community who wanted to carry a mark of belonging.
-   The tattoo work was personal, intimate. Every design told a story. Every session was a conversation.
-   When the Dogs formally established, Dame's tattoo work became ritual. But it started here — a young woman with steady hands and stained fingers, making permanence on skin.

### Dame and Big 9
-   Their relationship deepened through shared purpose. She filmed his interventions. He stood guard while she documented.
-   They didn't discuss founding an organisation. They were already living as one.

## Snout's Network Matures (~2016-2019)

### The Marlowe Arms Pub
-   Snout (35-38) held court at the **Marlowe Arms**. Not loudly — a pint, a corner seat, and quiet conversations with whoever sat down.
-   Shopkeepers reported trouble. Grandmothers reported suspicious newcomers. Workers from the Red Light described dangerous clients.
-   Snout passed information to Big 9. Not formally — a word, a description, a street name. The intelligence network existed before anyone called it that.

### Community Elders
-   Snout bridged the generation gap. He spoke to the older residents who remembered the North Ends before the decline, and to the younger ones who knew nothing else.
-   His credibility was built on decades: he never lied, never gossipped for sport, never broke confidence. When Snout said something mattered, people listened.

### Ms. Okoye's Frustration
-   **Ms. Okoye** (30s) arrived at NEPH as Welfare Coordinator, determined to make the system work from inside.
-   Within two years she understood: the system wasn't broken. It was designed this way. Grey jumpsuits, zero funding, teachers quitting mid-term.
-   She and Snout developed a quiet understanding: he told her which students needed help. She told him which students were in danger. Neither reported to anyone else.

## The Red Light District: Darkest Years (2016-2019)

### No Protection
-   Before the Dogs formalised patrols, workers on Hydrant Street relied on each other and luck.
-   Violence against workers was weekly. Sometimes nightly. Stabbings, beatings, clients who refused to pay and took what they wanted.
-   **Ash** (13-16 during this period) entered sex work during these years. A callboy, kind-faced, bright clothing in a grey world. He survived on charm and the protection of older workers.
-   Police response to worker violence: effectively zero. Reports were filed and forgotten. Arrests were rare and never led to prosecution.

### The Pimp Economy
-   Multiple networks competed for control of workers' earnings. 50-70% taken as "management fees."
-   Workers who tried to operate independently faced intimidation, assault, or worse.
-   Big 9's individual interventions disrupted some of this, but one man couldn't reshape an economy. That would require organisation.

## Captain Shaw's Final Years (~2016-2023)

### The Caravan Life
-   Shaw and Stray (7-10 during 2016-2019) lived simply. The caravan in the North Ends was home.
-   Shaw's training intensified as Stray grew. The boy was naturally quiet, naturally observant, naturally precise.
-   Shaw kept his sealed military past locked away. He never told Stray about his mother. He never explained why they lived in a caravan instead of a house.

### Shaw and the Community
-   Shaw was respected but distant. A man who nodded to shopkeepers but didn't linger. Who walked certain streets at certain hours but never explained why.
-   He was aware of Big 9. Whether they spoke is unclear. But two men dedicated to protecting the vulnerable in the same small borough could not have been entirely strangers.
-   **The Parallel**: Shaw's personal code — discipline, honour, protect without asking — mapped precisely onto what Big 9 was building. Whether Big 9 learned from Shaw, or both arrived at the same philosophy independently, is one of the canon's open questions.

## The West End Encroachment (2018-2019)

### Testing Boundaries
-   The **West End Gang** began probing North Ends territory. Not invasion — reconnaissance.
-   Drug runners tested corners. Scouts mapped the Red Light District. Money lenders offered impossible rates to desperate families.
-   Without organised resistance, these incursions met no opposition. Individual residents couldn't push back against an organised gang.
-   **This was the trigger**. Big 9, Dame, and Snout saw the same thing: individual protection wasn't enough. The North Ends needed something with a name.

## The Conversations That Built a Pack (Late 2019)

### Big 9 and Dame
-   "We can't keep doing this alone."
-   "Then we stop being alone."

### Big 9 and Snout (Marlowe Arms Pub)
-   Snout had the contacts. Big 9 had the presence. Dame had the vision.
-   Three people, one pint at a time, built the foundation of an organisation that would grow to 65 members in six years.

### The Name
-   "Stray Dogs" was not chosen in 2019 — it came in 2020 with the formal founding. But the identity was already forming.
-   Big 9's philosophy crystallised: **"We belong to no one, so we belong to everyone."**
-   The pack wasn't born. It was inevitable.

## Significance
-   **The Convergence**: Three different people — a fighter, an artist, and a listener — recognised the same void and decided to fill it together.
-   **The Pattern**: Everything the Dogs would become was already present in miniature. Protection (Big 9). Documentation (Dame). Intelligence (Snout). Community consent (Silence emerging organically).
-   **The Missing Piece**: The Dogs hadn't yet connected to the youngest generation. Stray, Zed, Rax, K-9 — all still children. Their time would come after the founding, when the pack grew beyond its founders.
-   **The Countdown Ends**: By late 2019, the question was no longer "will someone organise?" but "when?" The answer came in 2020.
