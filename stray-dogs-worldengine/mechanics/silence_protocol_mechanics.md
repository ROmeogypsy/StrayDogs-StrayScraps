# Silence Protocol Mechanics

## Overview
The mechanical execution of the **Silence Protocol**. How the community protects the **Stray Dogs** from law enforcement.

## The Trigger
-   **Police Incident**: When a Dog intervenes (assault, fight, arrest).
-   **Witness Check**: Any resident who sees it.

## The Response
1.  **Denial**: "No, Officer. Didn't see anything."
2.  **Obfuscation**: "I think it was some kids from South Ends."
3.  **Active Protection**: Hiding Dogs in shops/homes if pursued.
4.  **Information Vacuum**: No names, no descriptions, no CCTV (where broken).

## Failure Conditions
-   **Dog Betrayal**: If a Dog harms an innocent, the community speaks.
-   **Extortion**: If Dogs demand payment like a gang, the Silence breaks.

## Significance
-   **Power**: Makes 65 teenagers untouchable by the Met.
-   **Consent**: Proof the community *wants* the Dogs there.
