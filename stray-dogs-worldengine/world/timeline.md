# World Timeline

## PRE-FOUNDING ERA

### Pre-2010: The Decline of the North Ends
- **Metropolitan Police** withdraw from regular patrols. Response times stretch to hours.
- **Council defunding** shutters youth centres, community centres, libraries.
- **Red Light District** operates unprotected. Worker violence is weekly, unreported.
- **Pimp networks** take 50-70% of workers' earnings. No one intervenes.
- **West End Gang** consolidates from loose crews into organised operation.
- **St. Augustine's Academy** watches from The Hill. The class divide is architectural.
- **NEPH (The Doghouse)** opens as a brutalist holding pen. Grey jumpsuits. Zero funding.
- **Havenwood Care Centre** operates in the North Ends. Eventually closes under sealed circumstances.
- **Snout** (~1981) grows up in the North Ends. Builds community contacts over decades.
- **Big 9** (~1998) born. Childhood shaped by absence.
- **Dame** (~1999) born. Russian-born, arrives in North Ends as a child.

### 2009-2015: The Formative Years
- **Stray**, **Zed/Rax** (twins), and **Scraps/Harper Whitmore** born (~2009).
- **K-9 / Kian Nines** born (~2010). Big 9's little brother. Twelve-year age gap.
- **Captain Shaw** (discharged HM Royal Guard) raises Stray in a caravan in the North Ends.
- Shaw trains Stray from early childhood: combat, discipline, lip-reading, honour.
- **Big 9** (age 16, ~2014) begins intervening in street violence. Snout notices.
- **Zed** draws on walls with stolen chalk. **Rax** earns scholarship to St. Augustine's — the twins' paths split.
- **Harper Whitmore** groomed as West End Gang "Prince."

### 2016-2019: Before the Pack
- **Big 9** (18-21) patrols North Ends informally. No name, no crew. Acts first, explains never.
- **Big 9's first Red Light intervention**: removes a pimp who hospitalised a worker. Word spreads.
- **Dame** meets Big 9 (~2017). Begins documenting North Ends life. Tattoos Big 9: "Lead by Doing" on his neck.
- **Snout** holds intelligence court at the Marlowe Arms Pub. Passes information to Big 9.
- **Ms. Okoye** arrives at NEPH as Welfare Coordinator. Learns the system is designed to fail.
- **Ash** (13-16) enters sex work during these years.
- **West End Gang** probes North Ends territory (2018-2019). Drug runners test corners.
- **Late 2019**: Big 9, Dame, and Snout begin planning. The pack isn't born — it's inevitable.
