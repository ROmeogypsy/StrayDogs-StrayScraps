# West End Gang

## Overview
Hundreds of members. Wealthy, organized, and expanding. Scraps' former crew. Characterized by **designer streetwear**, high-end weapons, and a ruthless pursuit of profit and status.

## Philosophy
-   **Profit First**: Extort, deal, dominate.
-   **Status**: Flaunt wealth. Designer brands. Expensive cars.
-   **Violence**: Use overwhelming force (guns, numbers) to solve problems.
-   **Reputation**: Humiliation must be avenged. (Stray disarmed their leader).

## Operations
-   **Territory**: West End District, pushing into North Ends.
-   **Tactics**: Scouts (level 1), Intimidation (level 2), Coordinated Attacks (level 4).
-   **Target**: The **Stray Dogs** (humiliation, resistance).
-   **Scraps**: Their former "Prince" turned traitor. Marked for death.

## Current Tensions (Feb 2026)
-   **Retaliation**: Imminent. Scraps has been claimed by the Dogs.
-   **North Ends Expansion**: Attempting to take over Red Light protection racket (which Dogs run for free/low cost).
-   **Leader's Ego**: Humiliated by Stray in late 2025. Personal vendetta.
