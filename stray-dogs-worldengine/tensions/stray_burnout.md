# Stray Burnout Tension

## Overview
**Stray** (The Silent Sentinel) is working 4 graveyard shifts per week (2AM-6AM), plus school/street presence. His tinnitus is screaming ("locked catastrophic") since Ash's death. He is refusing help.

## Status: Near Collapse
-   **Physical**: Visible exhaustion, bloodshot eyes, trembling hands.
-   **Mental**: Haunted by Ash (3 doors down), hyper-vigilant.
-   **Community**: Dogs are noticing. Dame is worried. Needles is monitoring.

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Near Miss**: Stray fails to spot a threat due to exhaustion.
-   **Tinnitus Spike**: Sudden deafness/disorientation during a confrontation.
-   **Collapse**: Physical collapse mid-shift.

## Resolution Paths
-   **Intervention**: Dogs force him to rest (High Command order).
-   **Crisis**: Stray fails, someone gets hurt, he spirals.
-   **Acceptance**: Stray accepts help (moves into Kennel, reduces shifts).
