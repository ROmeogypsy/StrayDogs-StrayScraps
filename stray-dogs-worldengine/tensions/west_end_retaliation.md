# West End Retaliation

## Overview
The **West End Gang** is preparing to retaliate against the **Stray Dogs** for two reasons:
1.  **Scraps' Betrayal**: Their "Prince" (Harper Whitmore) joined the enemy.
2.  **Leader's Humiliation**: Stray publicly disarmed their leader (Level 5 action) in late 2025.

## Status: Level 2 (Intimidation) → Level 3 (Probing Attack)
-   **Scouts**: Seen near Red Light and NEPH.
-   **Threats**: Verbal warnings to shopkeepers.
-   **Incident**: West End members seen testing Dog response times near The Hydrant.

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Scraps Sighting**: If Scraps is seen publicly as a Dog.
-   **Attack on Dog**: A West End member injures/kills a Dog (Level 4/5 action).
-   **Territory Push**: West End attempts to take over a protection racket.

## Resolution Paths
-   **War**: Full conflict (Level 6). North Ends vs West End.
-   **Show of Force**: Dogs deter attack through massive mobilization.
-   **Mediation**: Unlikely (Leader's ego is bruised).
