## HOW TO DESCRIBE STRAY IN SCENES

### First Appearance:
> The figure on the bench was less a person and more a statue carved from grey static. Headphones clamped over his ears, eyes tracking the Plaza with predatory focus. He wore the NEPH jumpsuit like armor, the red paw on his chest faded to the color of dried blood.

### Subsequent Mentions:
> Stray adjusted his headphones—a twitch, barely visible.
> His bloodshot eyes narrowed.
> The grey silhouette detached itself from the wall.
