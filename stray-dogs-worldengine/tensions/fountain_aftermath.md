# Fountain Aftermath Tension

## Overview
A recent altercation at **The Plaza** where **Rax** (embedded Dog) "accidentally" splashed **Leo** (Academy Prefect) with fountain water to distract him from harassing NEPH students.

## Status: Simmering
-   **Leo's Rage**: Humiliated, Leo is targeting Rax ("accident" wasn't).
-   **Rax's Cover**: Slipping. Leo suspects Rax isn't just a "Golden Retriever".
-   **NEPH Students**: Rax is becoming a quiet hero to them, dangerous for his cover.

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Leo Retaliation**: Leo targets Rax in Lacrosse or off-campus.
-   **Rax Exposure**: Rax uses "Teeth Down" (violence) to defend NEPH students again.
-   **Alistair Intervention**: Alistair must choose sides (Order vs Justice).

## Resolution Paths
-   **Rax Expulsion**: Leo gets Rax kicked out (Rax becomes full-time Dog).
-   **Leo Humiliation**: Leo escalates and fails publicly.
-   **Truce**: Unlikely.
