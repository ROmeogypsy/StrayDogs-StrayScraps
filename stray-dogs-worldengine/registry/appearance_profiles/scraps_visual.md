## HOW TO DESCRIBE SCRAPS IN SCENES

### First Appearance:
> The boy in the designer hoodie looked like a prince dragged through the mud. Scraps stood with his back to the wall, eyes darting. The black dagger behind his ear stood out stark against his pale skin—a target painted on a traitor. He wore a heavy military coat that swallowed his frame, the only shield he had left.

### Subsequent Mentions:
> Scraps pulled the collar of the greatcoat tighter.
> His hand went to the tattoo behind his ear—a nervous tic.
> The grey-green eyes were hard, calculating.
