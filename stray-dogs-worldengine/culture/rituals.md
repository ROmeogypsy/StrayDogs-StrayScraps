# Rituals

## 1. THE MARKING (Tattoo)
-   **Occasion**: A new Dog is fully accepted.
-   **Method**: Dame hand-pokes the tattoo in The Kennel.
-   **Significance**: Permanent loyalty. "You are not Stray anymore. You are Dog."
-   **Scraps**: Has a West End dagger tattoo (blade down = killed for the set). It must be covered or integrated.

## 2. THE VISIT (Big 9)
-   **Occasion**: Weekly (Dame).
-   **Method**: Wormwood Scrubs visitation. No phones. Just words.
-   **Significance**: Reconnecting with the founder's spirit ("Lead by Doing").
-   **Stray**: Goes to the prison wall, touches it, but can't go inside (trauma/record).

## 3. THE SILENCE (Community)
-   **Occasion**: Police inquiry.
-   **Method**: Collective denial ("No comment.").
-   **Significance**: Reaffirms the community's choice of Dogs over Police.

## 4. THE SHIFT CHANGE
-   **Occasion**: Morning/Afternoon/Graveyard handoff at The Hydrant.
-   **Method**: Brief nod. "Safe?" "Safe."
-   **Significance**: Continuity of protection.
