# Ash (Deceased)

## Overview
Age: 19. **Red Light Callboy**. Protected by the **Stray Dogs**. Killed on **Stray's Watch** in **Late 2023** (September). His death was the final breaking point for Stray's silence.

## Physical Description
-   **Build**: Slim, gentle features (based on photos in The Kennel).
-   **Face**: Often smiling in photos. Kind eyes.
-   **Clothing**: Bright, colorful (contrast to the grey).
-   **Distinctive**: Always offered Stray food/coffee on shift.

## Death
-   **Time**: 2:47 AM.
-   **Location**: **Three Doors Down** from Stray's post (Hydrant St).
-   **Cause**: Stabbed by a violent client (random).
-   **Stray's Failure**: Stray heard the scuffle but was seconds too late. Tinnitus spiked.

## Legacy
-   **The Silence**: Stray stopped speaking after Ash died ("Words didn't save him.").
-   **The Radius**: Stray now patrols a tighter radius ("Not three doors.").
-   **Memorial**: Flowers always fresh at the spot (maintained by workers/Stray).

## Relationships
-   **Stray**: Protector/Friend. Ash was the only one who got him to smile.
-   **Whistle**: Also on shift. Shares the guilt.
-   **Red Light Workers**: Mourned deeply.
