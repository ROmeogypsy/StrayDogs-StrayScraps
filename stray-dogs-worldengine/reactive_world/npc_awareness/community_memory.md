# Community Memory System

## HOW MEMORY WORKS

### Memory Persistence:
- **PERMANENT**: Lives saved/taken, betrayals, major events
- **LONG-TERM**: Repeated behaviors, significant help
- **SHORT-TERM**: Single interactions, minor conflicts
- **FORGOTTEN**: Generic presence, routine actions

## MEMORY CATEGORIES

### Personal Memory (Individual NPCs)

**Example: Red Light Worker "Maria"**
- ██████ PERMANENT: Stray saved her from violent client (March 2024)
- █████░ LONG-TERM: Always works graveyard (2 years protection)
- ████░░ SHORT-TERM: Nodded at her last Tuesday

**How Maria Treats Stray**:
- Smiles when sees him
- Offers food sometimes
- Trusts completely
- Would lie to police for him
