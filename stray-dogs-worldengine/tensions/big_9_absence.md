# Big 9 Absence Tension

## Overview
**Big 9** (Founder, Spiritual Leader) is imprisoned (Whole Life Order) for killing three pimps to save K-9 in March 2023. His absence is a gaping hole in the **Stray Dogs**.

## Status: Grief & Burden
-   **Dame**: Visits him weekly (when allowed). Leads operations with steel but is privately broken.
-   **K-9**: Carries the guilt ("He did it for me"). Uses SD Media to honor him.
-   **Stray**: The silence is deafening. Tinnitus locks catastrophic. He visits the prison wall but can't go in.
-   **High Command**: Struggling to maintain unity without his moral compass.

## Escalation Triggers
-   **Denied Visitation**: Dame is blocked from seeing him (administrative cruelty).
-   **Prison Incident**: Big 9 is attacked/injured inside.
-   **Despair**: Dame considers stepping down.

## Resolution Paths
-   **Endurance**: Dogs learn to lead without him present.
-   **Breakdown**: High Command fractures under pressure.
-   **Contact**: Big 9 sends a message that refocuses them.
