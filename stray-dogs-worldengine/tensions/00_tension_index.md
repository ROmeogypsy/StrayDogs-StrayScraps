# Tension Index (February 2026)

## Active Conflicts
-   **West End Retaliation**: Imminent attack. Scraps' betrayal + Leader's humiliation.
-   **Scraps Integration**: Conditional acceptance. Ruckus (NEPH) vs. High Command trust.
-   **Fountain Aftermath**: Rax splashed Leo. Academy vs. NEPH tension boiling over.

## Internal Struggles
-   **Stray's Burnout**: 4 graveyard shifts/week. Tinnitus screaming. Collapse imminent.
-   **Big 9's Absence**: The spiritual void. Dame's grief. K-9's burden.
-   **Alistair's Awakening**: Head Boy questioning the system. Red chalk in desk.

## External Threats
-   **Police Attention**: SD Media success brings unwanted visibility.
-   **South Gangs**: Probe from the south (Ghost Dogs reporting movement).
