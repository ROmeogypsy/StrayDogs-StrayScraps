## EXAMPLE: Big 9's Arrest (Late 2023)

**Primary Action**: Big 9 arrested, Whole Life Order

**Immediate Circle**:
- K-9: Massive guilt, drives all his actions now
- Dame: Broke down crying, Stray held her
- Dogs: Could have collapsed, instead galvanized

**Secondary Circle**:
- North Ends Community: Mourned, but respected sacrifice
- West End: Saw opportunity (power vacuum), tested boundaries
- Zed: Dragged by rivals one week later (direct consequence)

**Tertiary Circle**:
- Academy: K-9 transferred there (Dame's deal for "reformed student")
- SD Media: K-9 took over public face (necessary leadership)
- Stray: Lost verbal mentor, silence deepened

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Immediate circle devastated
- Month 1: Secondary circle adjusting
- Year 1: Tertiary ripples still emerging
