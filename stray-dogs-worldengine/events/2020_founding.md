# 2020: The Founding

## Overview
**Big 9**, **Dame**, and **Snout** form the **Stray Dogs** in response to police neglect and gang violence in the North Ends.

## Key Events
-   **First Patrol**: Big 9 stops an assault on a Red Light worker. Community notices.
-   **The Name**: "Stray Dogs" chosen. "We belong to no one, so we belong to everyone."
-   **Philosophy**: "Lead by Doing" established. No speeches, just protection.

## Significance
-   **Origin**: The moment the North Ends stopped waiting for help and helped itself.
-   **Legacy**: The foundation of everything that follows.
