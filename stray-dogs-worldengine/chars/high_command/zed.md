# Zed (The Zombie / Z-Artist)

## Overview
Age: 17. Underboss and Strategic Thinker. Rax's twin. Joined at 14. Dragged by rivals in late 2023 (face/back destroyed), earning him the name "Zombie". Secretly the **Z-Artist** (creates red chalk art across London).

## Physical Description
-   **Build**: Thin, scarred, walks with a slight limp (permanent drag injury).
-   **Face**: Left side destroyed by asphalt (dragged 3 blocks at 40mph). Cheekbone visible, jaw misaligned. One eye milky/clouded.
-   **Clothing**: Always covers skin (hoodies, long sleeves) to hide scars. Often wears a mask/scarf.
-   **Distinctive**: Red chalk dust under fingernails.

## Personality
-   **Strategic**: Cold, calculating, sees the board clearly. "Simple."
-   **Traumatized**: The drag changed him from aggressive to terrifyingly calm.
-   **Artistic**: Uses chalk art (Z-Artist) as therapy/legacy.

## Operations
-   **Underboss**: Handles the hard choices Dame is too emotional to make.
-   **Planner**: Coordinates complex ops (like the West End humiliation).
-   **Chalk Keeper**: Gives Alistair the red chalk.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
-   **Scraps**: Sees Scraps as a weapon/asset ("Stray claimed him. That's enough."). Added the 65th tally mark.
-   **Z-Artist**: His alter ego is gaining fame, risking exposure.
-   **Rax**: Protective of his twin, who is his opposite (embedded/unscarred).

## Relationships
-   **Rax**: Twin brother. Mystical connection (feels his pain).
-   **Dame**: respects his cold logic.
-   **Stray**: Only person who understands the silence/pain.
-   **Scraps**: A mirror (both marked/changed).
