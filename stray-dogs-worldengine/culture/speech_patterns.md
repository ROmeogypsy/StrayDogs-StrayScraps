# Speech Patterns

## STRAY
-   **Silent Sentinel**: 1-3 words max ("Yes.", "No.", "Safe.").
-   **West Coast Flow**: Rare full sentences when relaxed/teaching.
-   **Philosophical**: "Dogs lead by doing."

## K-9
-   **Roadman Slang**: Heavy, fast, aggressive. "Bruv", "innit", "mandem", "allow it".
-   **Consistent**: Never code-switches. Always authentic North Ends.

## RAX
-   **Code-Switcher**: Seamless transition between Posh ("Absolutely, old chap!") and Roadman ("Oi bruv, what's good?").
-   **Golden Retriever**: Energetic, bouncy.

## DAME
-   **Russian-Accented**: Hard consonants, dropped articles ("Sit." vs "Sit down.").
-   **Curses**: "Gospodi" (Lord), "Durak" (Fool), "Stoy" (Stop).
-   **Commanding**: Artist's precision.

## ZED
-   **Strategic**: Minimal words. "Simple."
-   **Z-Artist Persona**: Fake Slavic accent ("Is finished.").

## NEPH FRONT
-   **Rough**: Street slang mixed with teen bravado. Loud (Ruckus).
-   **Quiet**: Whistle (lip-reading, sign).
