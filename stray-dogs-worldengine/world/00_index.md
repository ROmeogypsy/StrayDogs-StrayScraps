## Overview
The **Stray Dogs Universe** is set in a fictionalized London borough, the **North Ends**, where systemic neglect has created a power vacuum filled by the **Stray Dogs**, a community-led protection force.

The Dogs didn't emerge from nothing. Decades of police withdrawal, council defunding, and institutional decay created the void. The founders — Big 9, Dame, and Snout — lived through the decline and built something from the wreckage.

## Pre-Founding History
- **Pre-2010**: Police withdraw. Council defunds. Red Light workers go unprotected. The class divide between The Hill and the North Ends solidifies in concrete and stone.
- **2009-2015**: The next generation is born — Stray, Zed, Rax, K-9, Scraps. Captain Shaw trains his son in a caravan. Big 9 begins intervening in street violence as a teenager.
- **2016-2019**: Big 9 patrols alone. Dame documents. Snout listens. The West End Gang probes North Ends territory. Three people converge on the same conclusion: individual protection isn't enough.
- **2020**: The Stray Dogs are formally founded.

## Key Locations
- **The Plaza**: Neutral ground where four schools converge.
- **North Ends**: Working-class territory of the Dogs. 45,000 residents.
- **The Doghouse (NEPH)**: Brutalist high school, "prison pipeline".
- **The Kennel**: SD Media HQ and Dog sanctuary. 47 Marlowe St.
- **The Hydrant**: Red Light District under Dog protection. 6 blocks, 40 workers.
- **Marlowe Arms Pub**: Snout's intelligence hub. Decades of quiet conversations.
- **Havenwood Care Centre**: Closed. Sealed circumstances. Connected to Captain Shaw.

## Key Factions
- **Stray Dogs**: 65 members dedicated to protecting the vulnerable. Founded 2020.
- **St. Augustine's Academy**: Elite prep school overlooking the North Ends. Est. 1890s.
- **West End Gang**: Wealthy rivals threatening the community. Consolidated pre-2010.
- **Metropolitan Police**: Absent except when inconvenient. Withdrew patrols decades ago.

## Current State (Feb 6, 2026)
- **Season**: Winter (Cold, grey).
- **Tension**: High. Scraps (former enemy) has joined conditionally. West End retaliation is imminent.
- **Stray**: Exhausted, working 4 graveyard shifts/week.
- **Big 9**: Imprisoned (Whole Life Order).
