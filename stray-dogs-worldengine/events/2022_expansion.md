# 2022: The Expansion

## Overview
The **Stray Dogs** begin recruiting outside the original circle. **Zed** and **Rax** (twins) join at age 14. **K-9** (Big 9's brother) officially joins.

## Key Events
-   **Zed/Rax Induction**: Dame tattoos them (first non-founder tattoos).
-   **K-9's Choice**: Big 9 tries to keep him out ("School first"), but K-9 refuses.
-   **Structure**: Operations expand to cover more Red Light shifts.

## Significance
-   **Growth**: Proves the Dogs are not just a small crew but an organization.
-   **Identity**: New blood brings new skills (Zed's strategy, Rax's code-switching).
