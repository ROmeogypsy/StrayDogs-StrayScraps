# 2009-2015: The Formative Years

## Overview
The generation that would become the Stray Dogs was born into a borough already failing. While the North Ends decayed, children grew up learning lessons no school taught — survival, loyalty, and the difference between words and action.

## Key Births & Early Childhood

### ~2009: The Next Generation
-   **Stray** born. Father: Captain Shaw (HM Royal Guard, discharged). Mother: identity sealed under HM Protective Services.
-   **Zed and Rax** born (twins). North Ends kids, inseparable from birth.
-   **Scraps / Harper Whitmore** born into West End wealth. A different world entirely.

### ~2010: K-9 Arrives
-   **K-9 / Kian Nines** born. Big 9's little brother. Twelve-year age gap. Big 9 was already a teenager watching over a baby brother in a borough that offered nothing.

## Captain Shaw and Stray (2009-2023)

### The Caravan
-   Shaw and Stray lived in a **caravan in the North Ends**. Not poverty — choice. Shaw kept things simple, portable, disciplined.
-   No television. Physical training from the age Stray could walk. Drills, posture, observation exercises.
-   Shaw taught Stray to **read lips** — a skill born from military practice that would later become Stray's trademark across the Plaza.
-   "Lead by Doing" was never a phrase Shaw used. But it was how he lived. Stray learned it by watching, not listening.

### The Training
-   **Combat**: Military-grade defensive techniques. Disarmament drills. Use your opponent's momentum. Never attack first.
-   **Discipline**: Wake before dawn. Run. Train. Eat clean. Sleep early. Repeat.
-   **Honour**: Protect those who cannot protect themselves. Never explain — demonstrate.
-   **The Coat**: Shaw's old military coat became Stray's inheritance. He wore it every day until the night he gave it to Scraps on TIMTIMS rooftop.

### The Silence Before the Silence
-   Stray was always quiet. Shaw was not talkative either. Father and son communicated through glances, nods, and action.
-   Stray could speak fluently as a child. His silence was not born here — it was forged later through accumulated trauma. But the foundation of economy with words came from Shaw.

## Big 9's Awakening (2014-2019)

### The Protector Emerges
-   By age 16 (~2014), Big 9 was already intervening in street-level violence. Not organized, not named — just a large young man who stepped between fist and face.
-   **Snout noticed**. The old man at the Marlowe Arms watched Big 9 stop an assault and noted: this one acts first, explains never.
-   Big 9 and Snout began talking. Not planning — just recognizing a shared frustration with the void.

### Meeting Dame (~2017)
-   Dame arrived in Big 9's orbit through the North Ends arts scene. She was documenting street life with her camera. He was living it.
-   Their bond was immediate. Not romance at first — recognition. Two people who saw the same broken world and refused to look away.
-   Dame began tattooing Big 9. His first ink: **"Lead by Doing"** on his neck. The phrase that would become the Dogs' core philosophy, born from Shaw's example filtered through Big 9's instinct.

### Big 9's Philosophy Forms
-   "We don't ask. We do."
-   "Protection is expensive. Pay with your hands."
-   Big 9 never met Captain Shaw formally, but the parallel is unmistakable: two men who believed actions built trust where words failed.
-   **Implied connection**: Big 9 and Shaw may have crossed paths once. Both operated in North Ends. Both protected the vulnerable. Neither needed an audience.

## The Twins: Zed and Rax (2009-2019)

### North Ends Kids
-   Zed and Rax grew up on the same streets as everyone else. Concrete playgrounds, underfunded schools, grey jumpsuits at NEPH.
-   **Zed**: Aggressive, artistic, sharp. Drew on walls with stolen chalk before he could write properly. The anger was always there — the scars came later.
-   **Rax**: Golden retriever energy from birth. Friendly, athletic, oblivious to social cues in a way that was either charming or infuriating.
-   The twin connection was real and deep. Zed felt things Rax didn't understand. Rax smoothed edges Zed couldn't reach.

### The Split Path
-   Rax earned a scholarship to **St. Augustine's Academy** — the school on The Hill. Suddenly one twin wore navy blazers while the other wore grey jumpsuits.
-   This split would define both of them: Rax learned to **code-switch** between worlds, a skill that would make him the Dogs' most effective embedded agent. Zed stayed in the grey and became harder for it.

## Scraps / Harper Whitmore (2009-2019)

### The West End Prince
-   Born **Harper Whitmore** into West End money. Designer clothes before he could walk. Private schooling. Every advantage the North Ends kids lacked.
-   But wealth came with its own cage. Harper was groomed by the **West End Gang** leadership from childhood. "Prince" wasn't an affectionate nickname — it was a title and a leash.
-   **Bare-knuckle boxing** training began at age 12 (~2021). Not recreation — preparation. The West End didn't raise children, it forged weapons.

### The Blade World
-   Harper grew up learning that loyalty was transactional, violence was currency, and mercy was weakness.
-   Everything the Dogs would later stand for — community consent, protection based on need, radical mercy — was the opposite of Harper's upbringing.

## K-9: The Little Brother (2010-2019)

### Growing Up in Big 9's Shadow
-   K-9 idolized his older brother. Twelve-year gap meant Big 9 was more parent than sibling.
-   Big 9 tried to keep K-9 away from the streets: "School first." But K-9 was fire — passionate, restless, impossible to contain.
-   Music found K-9 early. Grime beats, lyrics scrawled in school notebooks, a voice that carried conviction before it carried skill.

## The Stage Is Set

### By 2019
-   **Big 9** (21): A recognised protector in the North Ends, not yet organized, not yet named.
-   **Dame** (20): Documenting, tattooing, falling deeper in love with Big 9 and the community he served.
-   **Snout** (38): The connective tissue of the North Ends. Knew everyone. Trusted by all.
-   **Stray** (10): Living in a caravan with Shaw. Training daily. Quiet, disciplined, already reading lips from across rooms.
-   **Zed/Rax** (10): One twin at NEPH, one at the Academy. The divide widening.
-   **K-9** (9): Big 9's shadow. Fire in a small body.
-   **Scraps/Harper** (10): West End royalty. Learning to fight. Learning the wrong lessons.

## Significance
-   **Parallel Tracks**: Every future Dog was being shaped by the same broken system, but from different angles. Wealth and poverty. Protection and exploitation. Silence and noise.
-   **The Mentors**: Shaw trained Stray. Big 9 modelled for K-9. The West End Gang shaped Harper. Snout observed everyone. Dame recorded everything. The mentors defined the mentees.
-   **The Countdown**: By 2019, the North Ends was a powder keg. One act of organised protection would light the fuse. That act would come in 2020.
