# Rax Kidd (The Heart)

## Overview
Age: 17. **Zed's Twin**. Embedded agent at **St. Augustine's Academy**. Scholarship student. Lacrosse star (#9). Known for his "Golden Retriever" energy, but hides a brutal "Teeth Down" side.

## Physical Description
-   **Build**: Athletic, fast, lacrosse player physique.
-   **Face**: Open, grinning, handsome (contrast to Zed's scars).
-   **Clothing**: Academy navy blazer, perfectly worn. Or roadman streetwear when "off duty".
-   **Distinctive**: Constantly code-switching (Posh ↔ Roadman).

## Personality
-   **Golden Retriever**: Bouncy, optimistic, seemingly oblivious.
-   **Loyal**: To Zed above all. To the Dogs. To K-9 ("Best Friends Forever").
-   **Teeth Down**: When threatened/Dogs threatened, the smile drops. Pure, cold violence (Tier 1).

## Operations
-   **Embedded Agent**: Gathers intel from "The Hill" (Academy gossip/politics).
-   **Bridge**: Connects the two worlds (Navy vs Grey).
-   **Protector**: Quietly looks out for NEPH kids at the Plaza.

## Current Status (Feb 2026)
-   **Fountain Incident**: Splashed Leo to protect NEPH kids. Leo is investigating him.
-   **K-9**: Inseparable. Doesn't understand Nala's "Boyfriend Theory".
-   **Zed**: Feels his twin's pain physically (mystical bond).

## Relationships
-   **Zed**: Other half. Guilt over being the "pretty one".
-   **K-9**: Best friend/Soulmate (platonic?).
-   **Alistair**: Lacrosse captain. Respects him, wary of his awakening.
-   **Nala**: Thinks she's hilarious (she thinks they're dating).
