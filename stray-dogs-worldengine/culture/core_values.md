# Core Values

## 1. LEAD BY DOING
-   **Meaning**: We don't ask for permission. We act.
-   **Application**: If a light is out, fix it. If a worker is threatened, intervene.
-   **Big 9's Words**: "Talk is cheap. Protection is expensive. Pay with your hands."

## 2. PROTECT BASED ON NEED
-   **Meaning**: Vulnerability dictates priority, not tribe or loyalty.
-   **Application**: We protect Scraps (enemy) because he is hunted. We protect Maria (Red Light) because she is unsafe.
-   **Stray's Act**: Gave his coat to Harper (Scraps) on the rooftop. Radical mercy.

## 3. COMMUNITY CONSENT (The Silence)
-   **Meaning**: We exist because the North Ends *wants* us to.
-   **Application**: We don't extort. We don't act like a gang. We serve.
-   **The Power**: The community protects us from the police (Silence Protocol).

## 4. TRANSFORMATION
-   **Meaning**: People can change. Mercy is possible.
-   **Application**: Scraps' integration. Alistair's awakening.
-   **Cost**: Change is painful (Zed's scars, Scraps' loss of status). But worth it.
